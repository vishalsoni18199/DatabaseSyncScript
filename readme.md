Make sure to replace the following placeholders in the script:

impala_host: Replace with the hostname or IP address of your Impala server.
your_table: Replace with the name of the table in Oracle that contains the "last mv refresh" column.
other_table: Replace with the name of the table in the other database that contains the "last mv refresh" column.
your_job: Replace with the name of the Oracle job you want to check.
Adjust the script as per your specific environment and ensure you have the necessary access and permissions to connect to the Impala server and the Oracle database. Modify the pipeline execution part according to your requirements.
